# WebProjects
All the files located in here were done by Goh Chor Shuan, Edwin Chua, Justin Quek and Jeremy Chong at Nanyang Polytechnic during
Semester 1 of the PFP year, Web Publishing project.

The purpose of the website was to show our knowledge on HTML, CSS and basic Javascript. We have also referenced from W3Schools and seeked
help from our lecturer for basic Javascript since we were not taught Javascript during PFP, but we wish to have it implemented so our
website would have more functions.

The website is based on multiple Korean POP agencies, which features multiple K-POP groups, idols and solo artists which we found
inspiration from.

Our website features a Home Page, Artist Page, Store Page, Auditions Page, Contact Us Page and Events Page. Each individual page was done
by individual members which was also supported by other members of the group. Each page also has it's unique features and functions.
